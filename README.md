# Apollo-FilterFlow


**Project Name: Apollo FilterFlow**
**Objective:** To develop a basic MERN stack application integrated with Apollo.io for managing
and filtering a large user base.
**Final Goal:** A rudimentary application that can be productionized and delivered to the client.

**Phase 1:** Project Initialization and Backend Development (Day 1-2)
**Scope:**
- Initialize the project repository and set up the MERN stack environment.
- Develop the backend with Node.js and Express.js, focusing on API endpoints that
interact with the Apollo.io API to receive filters and send data.
- Set up MongoDB for data management.

**Timeline:**
Day 1: Project setup and begin backend development.
Day 2: Complete API endpoints for basic filters (job title).

**Phase 2:** Frontend Development and API Integration (Day 3-4)
**Scope:**
- Create the React.js frontend structure.
- Develop components for the chat facility, filters panel, and results display.
- Integrate the frontend with the backend API to send and receive filter data.

**Timeline:**
Day 3: Frontend development and initiate API integration.
Day 4: Implement dynamic data display based on filters.

**Phase 3:** Testing Application and backlog (Day 5-6)
**Scope:**
-  Execute comprehensive testing to validate application functionality and performance.
Enhance API efficiency based on test results.

**Timeline:**
**Day 5 & 6:** Perform testing, address identified issues, and refine the API for optimal
performance.

**Phase 4:** Optimization, and Deployment (Day 7)
**Scope:**
-  Optimize the code for better efficiency.
-  Prepare the application for deployment on a cloud platform.

**Timeline:**
